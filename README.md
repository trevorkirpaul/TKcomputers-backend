# TKcomputer

## backend server for [TKComputer, ecommerce app](https://github.com/trevorkirpaul/TKcomputers)

backend: node,express

I based this server on [a server I made](https://github.com/trevorkirpaul/boilerplate--express-api-auth) during a udemy course.

Comparing this to my backend for BartrDB should should a decent amount of growth and I definitely understand express a lot better now.

I still run into inssues but my main focus is front end. That being said, I'm proud of this project so far and I hope you can agree. :)
